Measuring machine tool energy consumption has always been tricky because of the diversity and complexity of machine tools. We took a first stab at developing a standard to measure machine tool energy consumption as part of a project supported by General Dynamics – OTS, National Center for Defense Manufacturing and Machining (NCDMM), and AMT. We developed the Baseline Energy Consumption (BEC) metric as a standard measure of the energy consumption of machine tools along with a companion test methodology. Applications of this metric include:
* Estimating the approximate energy requirements of operating a machine tool to manufacture a specific part
* Comparing the energy requirements of two machine tools that are being applied in similar activities
* Performing Return-on-Investment calculations to justify energy efficiency improvements in machine tool and machining technologies
* Assessing environmental impact of manufacturing processes from equipment energy consumption

A key consideration in designing the test methodology was to ensure that they could be performed within a reasonable amount of a time in a standard industrial setting without requiring any special workpieces, fixtures, or equipment. This pragmatic approach was explicitly selected because the goal of this metric is to serve as a figure of merit for the energy consumption of machine tools and manufacturing equipment. This metric does not intend to serve as a precise indication of the energy required by a machine tool to manufacture a specific part or to execute a specific operation. The first edition of the standard focused on measuring the BEC of lathe-type machine tools based on recording the power consumption during a series of controlled tests.

The energy consumption of a machine tool in a factory environment is determined by the relative time it spends in different states, including, idle, axes movement, and cutting. To capture the effect of these states, the baseline tests measure the average power consumption during tare usage, axes / component usage, and machining usage. Tare usage is measured based on the power consumption of the machine tool when it is in standby with its peripheral units turned on. Component usage is measured based on the power consumption when the machine tool components are being exercised, without any loaded workpiece (analogous to “air-cutting”). Machining usage is measured based on power consumption  during metal cutting at a fixed spindle speed at varying material removal rates on an arbitrary workpiece. These tests are based on the observation that the energy required to remove unit volume of material in a machine tool is largely dependent on the volumetric rate of removal, or material removal rate, and not on the process parameters.

The BEC metric is based on the average power consumed during these states. The three terms are weighted by duration factors to estimate the energy consumed by the machine during one hour of representative operation, where it is assumed that the machine tool spends 25% of the duration in tare usage, 25% in component usage (air-cutting/warmup etc.,) and 50% in machining usage.

We will be following up with case studies looking at how this standard was applied in comparing different machine tools.
