As we begin work on the 1.3 version of the MTConnect standard, the next big area to tackle is Parts. A part can be roughly defined as a piece of material that will have some transformative processes done to it to obtain another shape, composition, or structure. Along the way information will be collected about these transformative processes as they are performed and validated.

A part itself is an asset, but for the treatment in the standard we will consider it as a collection of assets. These assets are composed of the various programs, measurement plans, and processes that will be applied to it. They may also indicate the schedule and operation, but that is questionable. If we consider a part an asset that references other assets, then the problem becomes one of asset references, instead of having a master document that has everything.

One consideration is to make parts have the following information:

1. Descriptive information
2. Reference to part programs for each device
3. Reference to quality execution program for each device

Another area that needs to be considered is the quality measurement data collected from gauges and coordinate measurement devices and from process metrology. The information collected for the part measurements will be associated with the part itself through a parent reference. The part may or may not need to be updated to refer back to the measurement data, but this could be done. The measurements may reference a quality execution plan for that step and may replicate the tolerance information as well as the geometric information as well.

We will be talking more about Parts in MTConnect as we work on the standard. Watch this space!
