The New York Times [talks](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/12/sunday-review/big-datas-impact-in-the-world.html) about the impact of Big Data across a variety of fields, including retailing, voice recognition, and public health. They cite a report by Prof. Erik Brynjolfsson from MIT Sloan that 
> studied 179 large companies and found that those adopting “data-driven decision making” achieved productivity gains that were 5 percent to 6 percent higher than other factors could explain.
Certainly we can expect a larger impact in productivity gains in manufacturing. Traditional "data driven" techniques like process monitoring has itself brought productivity gains of over 10%. Big Data Analytics gives the opportunity to wring out further gains, because of the ability to handle unstructured data, which the article mentions:
> Data is not only becoming more available but also more understandable to computers. Most of the Big Data surge is data in the wild — unruly stuff like words, images and video on the Web and those streams of sensor data. It is called unstructured data and is not typically grist for traditional databases.
But the computer tools for gleaning knowledge and insights from the Internet era’s vast trove of unstructured data are fast gaining ground. At the forefront are the rapidly advancing techniques of artificial intelligence like natural-language processing, pattern recognition and machine learning.
We apply similar tools and techniques to look at unstructured manufacturing data. More about this coming up!
