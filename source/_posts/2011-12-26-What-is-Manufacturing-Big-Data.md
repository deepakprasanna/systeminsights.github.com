Big Data has increasingly been in the [news](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/26/technology/for-start-ups-sorting-the-data-cloud-is-the-next-big-thing.html?pagewanted=all), and is being touted as a kind of universal panacea to improve efficiency, decrease costs, and make the world a better place. We like keeping the conversation a lot more focused, and this blog will focus on Big Data from the manufacturing shop floor: how to collect it and more importantly, what to make of it. 

What kind of data is available from the manufacturing shop floor? Here are some examples:
- Operational: Device uptime, downtime, modes, states
- Diagnostic: Alarms, warnings, messages, notifications
- Process: Positions, velocities, acceleration, flow rates
- Environmental: Resource usage, energy consumption, effluents and emissions

So, what can we do with Manufacturing Big Data?
- Preventive Maintenance: Big Data can help us identify which devices are going to be fail by comparing their current operational patterns with past failure behavior. By mining across data from similar devices, we can even predict the failure of devices that have not failed in the past.  
- Part genealogy: Big Data can be used to build detailed genealogical models of complex parts, bringing together data on device operational states, process parameters, and machine health. 
- Design-to-manufacturing pipeline: Big Data can improve design decisions by enabling the use of manufacturing operational and diagnostic data to the design phase. 

At System Insights we apply Big Data to improve the efficiency and productivity of complex manufacturing systems. Our vimana software application is the first of its kind solution for the high speed collection, storage, and analysis of data from the manufacturing shop floor.
