    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>TNEB had revised the electricity tariff for the year 2012-13. The new tariff order is applicable from 01 April 2012.</p>

<h2>The Tariff</h2>

<p>The Tariff for Industrial Consumers (HT1A) is as follows:</p>

<h3>Basic Charges</h3>

<ul>
<li>Demand Charges -- INR 30  0 / kVA / month</li>
<li>Energy Charges -- INR 5.50 / kWh</li>
</ul>


<h3>Restrictions and Surchages</h3>

<h4>Power Factor:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Power Factor => 0.9 -- No Surcharge</li>
<li>0.9 > Power Factor => 0.85    -- 1% of Current Consumption Charges for every 0.01 reduction in PF from 0.9</li>
<li>0.85 > Power Factor => 0.75 -- 1.5% of Current Consumption Charges for every 0.01 reduction in PF from 0.9</li>
<li>Power Factor &lt; 0.75 -- 2% of Current Consumption Charges for every 0.01 reduction in PF from 0.9</li>
</ul>


<h4>Billable Demand:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Demand Charges will levied on Maximum Demand that has actually been registered for the month or 90% of the Sanctioned Demand whichever is higher.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Peak Hour Demand:</h4>

<ul>
<li>HT Industrial Consumers shall be billed 20% extra on the Energy Charges for the Energy recorded during the Peak hours</li>
<li>Duration of Peak hours will be 6:00am to 9:00am &amp; 6:00pm to 9:00pm</li>
</ul>


<h4>Night Hour:</h4>

<ul>
<li>HT Industrial Consumers will get a reduction of 5% on the Energy Charges for the Energy recorded during the Night hours</li>
<li>Duration of Night hour will be 10:00pm to 5:00am</li>
</ul>


<h4>Demand Integration Period:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Maximum Demand Integration period will be 15minutes</li>
</ul>


<h4>Harmonics:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Total Voltage Harmonic Distortion should not exceed 5%</li>
<li>Total Current Harmonic Distortion should not exceed 8%</li>
<li>If the harmonics level are not within the limits, then the consumer has to pay 15% of respective tariff as Compensation</li>
</ul>


<h2>Power Scenario in the State</h2>

<p>If we have detailed look into Tamilnadu Energy Scenario, the State has a Present Installed Capacity of 10,364.5 MW &amp; the Average Power Availability is about 8500 MW. The Demand Ranges from 11,500 MW to 12,500 MW which gives a clear indication that the state has a shortage of power to the tune of 3000 to 4000 MW. Moreover if we see the growth of consumers, it keeps increasing at a rate of 5% every year. Thus it makes us clear that the issue of Power shortage in the state will not be solved in the near future.</p>

<h3>Power Shortage Mitigation Measures:</h3>

<p>To mitigate the power shortages the electricity board has adopted Stricter Restriction &amp; Control measures for the consumers which includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>40% cut on Demand &amp; Energy for HT Industrial and Commercial Services</li>
<li>Load shedding of 2 hrs in Chennai &amp; its suburbs</li>
<li>Load shedding of 4 hrs in other Urban &amp; Rural areas</li>
<li>10% of Power supply during Peak hours for Industrial &amp; Commercial Services</li>
<li>Power Holiday for all HT &amp; LT consumers</li>
</ul>


<p>These restrictions may be relaxed based on the power availability. Despite this, the HT consumers allowed to make power purchase to Inter &amp; Intra State Open Access as a part of Demand Side Management Measure by Electricity Board.</p>

<p>Need of the Hour:</p>

<p>Increasing Energy &amp; Fuel prices, Stringent Regulations from Electricity Board, Uncertain Pricing in Power Purchases, builds up a greater pressure on the consumers to maintain their Energy Costs within limits. This demands the consumer to have an Energy Action Plan and use Energy in an Effective way to Enhance Competitiveness &amp; Maximize profits.</p>

<p>Consumers can consider some of the below mentioned measures as a part of their Energy Action Plan:</p>

<p>Immediate: (To Meet Power Shortage)</p>

<p>Power Purchase through Inter &amp; Intra-State Open Access</p>

<p>Conduct a Walk-through Energy Audit</p>

<p>Identify &amp; Implement low hanging Energy Saving projects which includes Power Factor Improvement, Reducing/Avoiding Idle Power Consumption of Equipment, Replacing/Avoiding use of inefficient equipment, Reducing
Air Compressor Leaks</p>

<p>Ensure purchase of Energy Efficient Equipment</p>

<p>Short Term: (To Ensure Efficient Energy Use)</p>

<p>Develop an Energy Management Plan</p>

<p>Initiate Energy Monitoring in the Plant/Facility. Energy Monitoring can be broadly classified into,</p>

<p>Supply Side Energy Monitoring</p>

<p>Enable understanding of Overall Energy Consumption &amp; Costs</p>

<p>Provide an overview about Demand Profile</p>

<p>Help in identifying efficiency improvement projects of the supply side</p>

<p>Enable conscious &amp; effective decision on Power Purchase</p>

<p>Demand Side Energy Monitoring</p>

<p>Provide break-up of Energy Consumption</p>

<p>Provide Insight about reasons for Peak Demand Shooting</p>

<p>Determine the losses in Distribution System</p>

<p>Enable identifying key areas of Energy Wastage</p>

<p>Facilitates cost justification for Energy Saving Projects</p>

<p>Track the progress of projects implemented</p>

<p>Conduct a Energy Audit to identify potential opportunities for Energy Savings</p>

<p>Explore the options for use of systems like Waste heat recovery, Solar Hot Water Generation, Solar Street Lighting</p>

<p>Long Term: (To Ensure Energy Sustainability)</p>

<p>Increase the share of Renewable Energy Sources. Explore the options for Captive Power Generation through Solar, Wind &amp; other non-conventional sources</p>

<p>Adopt latest &amp; Energy Efficient technology Wherever Possible</p>

<p>Benchmark Energy Consumption &amp; Target Specific Energy Reduction</p>

<p>To conclude, when it comes Energy Conservation &amp; Energy Sustainability it all starts with awareness..Be Aware!! Save Energy!!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The BEC standard discussed in the last post was applied in comparing the performance of three similar small-sized Lathes. The three devices were as follows (all brand names anonymized to protect the innocent!):</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2012-02-08-BEC-Case-Study-1-A.png"></p>

<p>The test conditions were as follows:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2012-02-08-BEC-Case-Study-1-B.png"></p>

<p>The BEC metric for the three devices is as follows:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2012-02-08-BEC-Case-Study-1-C.png"></p>

<p>Here is how the metric looks broken down into its components:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2012-02-08-BEC-Case-Study-1-D.png"></p>

<p>The results showed that Device A consumes significantly less energy than Device B and Device C. Extrapolating the BEC metric, the estimated annual energy usage for these machine tools can be calculated assuming that each device operates for 8,000 hours per year at a cost of US $0.09 per kWh of energy; similarly, the Carbon Footprint of the devices is also calculated, assuming a footprint of 0.6 kg CO2-eq/kWh. As we can see in the table below, selecting Device A saves more than $800/year compared to Device C, and $400/year compared to Device B.</p>

    <id>http://www.manufacturingbigdata.com/blog/2012/01/17/Baseline-Energy-Consumption</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Measuring machine tool energy consumption has always been tricky because of the diversity and complexity of machine tools. We took a first stab at developing a standard to measure machine tool energy consumption as part of a project supported by General Dynamics – OTS, National Center for Defense Manufacturing and Machining (NCDMM), and AMT. We developed the Baseline Energy Consumption (BEC) metric as a standard measure of the energy consumption of machine tools along with a companion test methodology. Applications of this metric include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Estimating the approximate energy requirements of operating a machine tool to manufacture a specific part</li>
<li>Comparing the energy requirements of two machine tools that are being applied in similar activities</li>
<li>Performing Return-on-Investment calculations to justify energy efficiency improvements in machine tool and machining technologies</li>
<li>Assessing environmental impact of manufacturing processes from equipment energy consumption</li>
</ul>


<p>A key consideration in designing the test methodology was to ensure that they could be performed within a reasonable amount of a time in a standard industrial setting without requiring any special workpieces, fixtures, or equipment. This pragmatic approach was explicitly selected because the goal of this metric is to serve as a figure of merit for the energy consumption of machine tools and manufacturing equipment. This metric does not intend to serve as a precise indication of the energy required by a machine tool to manufacture a specific part or to execute a specific operation. The first edition of the standard focused on measuring the BEC of lathe-type machine tools based on recording the power consumption during a series of controlled tests.</p>

<p>The energy consumption of a machine tool in a factory environment is determined by the relative time it spends in different states, including, idle, axes movement, and cutting. To capture the effect of these states, the baseline tests measure the average power consumption during tare usage, axes / component usage, and machining usage. Tare usage is measured based on the power consumption of the machine tool when it is in standby with its peripheral units turned on. Component usage is measured based on the power consumption when the machine tool components are being exercised, without any loaded workpiece (analogous to “air-cutting”). Machining usage is measured based on power consumption  during metal cutting at a fixed spindle speed at varying material removal rates on an arbitrary workpiece. These tests are based on the observation that the energy required to remove unit volume of material in a machine tool is largely dependent on the volumetric rate of removal, or material removal rate, and not on the process parameters.</p>

<p>The BEC metric is based on the average power consumed during these states. The three terms are weighted by duration factors to estimate the energy consumed by the machine during one hour of representative operation, where it is assumed that the machine tool spends 25% of the duration in tare usage, 25% in component usage (air-cutting/warmup etc.,) and 50% in machining usage.</p>

<p>We will be following up with case studies looking at how this standard was applied in comparing different machine tools.</p>
